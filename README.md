# Personal Configs Repo

Those are just configs that I have on my personal machine.

## How to Use

Put the files in a directory called `~/.config/yamens` and source the `entrypoint.sh` file into your shell prompt.

For executables, I use a directory called `~/.exec` that I add to `$PATH`.

## Files

* [entrypoint.sh](./entrypoint.sh): entry point and also dump for `.bashrc` configs that I have changed.
* [functions.sh](./functions.sh): custom shell functions.
* [nnn-config.sh](./nnn-config.sh)
