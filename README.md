# Personal Configs Repo

Those are just configs that I have on my personal machine.

## How to Use

Put the files in a directory called `~/.config/yamens` and source the `entrypoint.sh` file into it.

## Files

* entrypoint.sh: entry point and also dump for `.bashrc` configs that I have changed.
* functions.sh: custom shell functions.
* nnn-config.sh
